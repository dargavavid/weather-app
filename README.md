# Weather Forecast App

## Description

This is a very simple node.js application, that uses the Google Geocode API and the Darksky API to return weather information about a specified location.

## How to use
1. Navigate into root directory using terminal/console, then type **npm install** or **yarn install** (Linux users may have to prefix the command with *sudo* like this: *sudo npm install*). 
2. Requests can be made using the following syntax:

node app.js --address="00000, Some place"
```
